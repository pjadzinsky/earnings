Same problem with chromdriver. Followed instructions from Oct 25, 2019. 
* Go to https://chromedriver.chromium.org/chromedriver-canary
* Go into OS link
* Find LAST_CHANGE
* Back to the website, search for the "Commit position"
    * if that doesn't work, then do this
    * click on file to download, open and copy past release #
    * back to website, search for that release
* Open folder
* click on "chromedriver_mac64.zip" (downloads the file)
* open the zip
* right click on the chromedriver -> open with terminal (accept)
* move chromedriver to /usr/lobal/bin/

Same problem with chromdriver. Followed instructions from Oct 25, 2019. 
Downloaded latest release and copy/pasted it
into ~/PycharmProjects/auction (replacing old 'chromdriver'). Then I right clicked on the chromedriver file
and "open with" -> "terminal" (this does not open the file but asks just once if file should be trusted)

chromedriver Canary problems. Follow instruction on this link https://chromedriver.chromium.org/chromedriver-canary

Oct 19, 2019,

auction.com script kind of works, but it is very unstable. Bugs and constant problems.
I'm thinking whether instead of doing something as complex just do:
1. Get active auctions, save json file mapping auction_id to href
1. Grab all previous json file, for all new properties, download and save href url
1. Prepare a list with properties to query in zillow. These are all the properties that were active in the last
N days and are not active now.
1. Grab the DF of zillowed properties, anything in the list that is not in the df has to be queried
1. pass that list through zillow api. First that requires parsing each saved url to extract address and zip

There are different Crawling steps
1. gets all the auction_ids of properties actively being auctioned (and the html to the specific page)
2. gets the dataframe of properties already identified in the past as being active
3. computes the set of auction_ids that are in 1. but not in 2. (this are new property_ids)
4. for each auction id in 3, it gets into url identified in 1 and extracts property info. At this point
    we can save the 
5. computes a set of auctions_ids that are in 2. but not in 1. This are removed property_ids from 
    auction.com. These properties could have been removed because auction was canceled or it was conducted.
    Either way we have to get information on these. If status is 'Pending', we have to add it to list
    of properties to be zillowfied. Regardless of whether status is 'Pending'/'canceled' (don't know 
    how they show that info) we have to remove these properties from ACTIVE_AUCTION_FOLDER.
    
All the info I have so far is in a different format. To hack it I could get all the IDS of auctions
(regardless of status) and do it semi-manually.

I changed code to use a crawler. However the crawler now gets the whole html (rather than the the 'asset_list')
and now I had to fix the fields that are extracted onto the CSV (see config.URL_ATTRIBUTES)

Before September 07, 2019

# crawler
## important: versions
I started with chromedriver 77.0.3865.40 and Chrome Canary 78.0.3899.0 and it worked fine but at some point
OS updated my Chrome Canary to 79 and I couldn't find a chromedriver that matches (probably will be uploaded
soon).
I started by following this post: 
https://duo.com/decipher/driving-headless-chrome-with-python
Downloaded driver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads


# manually
 I started by following this by 'gioloe' response here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3314429/how-to-view-generated-html-code-in-firefox/3314453#3314453
 I found the element in the html that when I hover over, highlights the whole table of properties ('asset_list')
 Now I have to extract the different fields from the table
 address, city, zipcode, auction date, auction type, num_rooms, num_baths, est. resale value, opening_bid
 searching for 'data-elm-id' I found the following vaues
 
* asset_2654221_root
* asset_2654221_image
* asset_<number>_address_content_1: address
* asset_<number>_address_content_2: city, zipcode
* asset_2770278_auction_date
* asset_2654221_auction_type
* asset_2654221_beds
* asset_2654221_baths
* asset_2654221_sqft
* asset_2654221_toggle_save
* asset_2654221_No Buyer's Premium
* asset_2654221_No Buyer's Premium_label
* label_after_repair_value
* label_after_repair_value_value
* label_reserve
* label_reserve_value
* label_starting_bid
* label_starting_bid_value
